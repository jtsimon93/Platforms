# Platforms

_This project is a work in progress._

**Platforms** is a 2D platformer game built with **Raylib**, **C++**, and **Tiled** for level design. This project is a personal exploration into game development without the use of a full game engine.

The focus is on learning low-level game architecture, rendering, and level parsing. If you're interested in how to integrate Tiled maps into a Raylib-based game, you may find the tilemap loading and `.tmx` parsing code particularly useful.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or reuse any part of the project.

## ðŸ›  Building

All dependencies are included as Git submodules. Make sure to initialize them recursively after cloning this repo.

This project uses **CMake** for building. A cross-platform configuration is provided, including support for building a web version using **Emscripten**.

To build the web version, you'll need to already have Emscripten installed.

On Windows, PowerShell scripts are included to:

- Build the web version.
- Serve the output using Python (required for WASM to function correctly â€” opening the HTML file directly will not work).
